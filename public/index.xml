      <description>Description With XeroLinux no longer being a Distro, but a collection of Projects/Scripts, created with a simple goal in mind, making ArchLinux more approachable, easier to install and configure. That&amp;rsquo;s if you choose to use it, or even give it a try.&#xA;ArchLinux / KDE Plasma I have so many great ideas in the pipeline, it&amp;rsquo;s crazy ! I love working with ArchLinux. It&amp;rsquo;s the most flexible Distro I have ever had the pleasure to work with.</description>

      <description>Some Info The project is made of a few sub-projects. Below you will find the 3 I have finished and are ready for public consumption. More are on the way. Just keep coming back here for updates. Also feel free to suggest ideas on social&amp;hellip;&#xA;The Toolkit. This toolkit aims to be an all-in-one solution for post-installation, expediting your Arch setup. It&amp;rsquo;s offered as use at your own risk type of thing, with minimal support.</description>

      <description>Social Media Ok, so, if you want to ask me questions about my projects directly, you can do so by either joining the XeroLinux Forum or via the Mastodon instance.&#xA;Although I also have a Discord Server set up, it&amp;rsquo;s currently not very active. it&amp;rsquo;s sorta private, hence its name. It&amp;rsquo;s not set up to provide support for any of my projects, it&amp;rsquo;s just there for us to discuss everything from life to Open Source and other stuff.</description>

      <description>Below are the specs of my main Rig, the one I use to test &amp;amp; build XeroLinux. Also the one I game on and much much more.&#xA;I also have a DELL XPS 13 / 9360 Laptop that has a stupid 4K Touch Screen, Intel Core i7-7500U, 16GB RAM, and an Intel HD Graphics 620 iGPU. I primarily use it for testing stuff. From various Distros to various Kernels. It&amp;rsquo;s starting to show its age right about now lol.</description>
