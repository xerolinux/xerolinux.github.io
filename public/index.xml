      <description>Description With XeroLinux no longer being a Distro, but a collection of Projects/Scripts, created with a simple goal in mind, making ArchLinux more approachable, easier to install and configure. That&amp;rsquo;s if you choose to use it, or even give it a try.&#xA;ArchLinux / KDE Plasma I have so many great ideas in the pipeline, it&amp;rsquo;s crazy ! I love working with ArchLinux. It&amp;rsquo;s the most flexible Distro I have ever had the pleasure to work with.</description>

      <description>The Toolkit. This toolkit aims to be an all-in-one solution for post-installation, expediting your Arch setup. Please head on over to toolkit&amp;rsquo;s Github Page and check out the Wiki for more detailed information.&#xA;Xero-Layan Rice It&amp;rsquo;s the best KDE rice I have ever created, in my opinion. If you want to enjoy said rice on your system, feel free to teleport to Github and have fun. ðŸ˜€&#xA;Xero-Plasma Install Script With the help of this script you will be able to install Plasma in one of 4 methods as you can see in the image below.</description>

      <description>Social Media Ok, so, if you want to ask me questions about my projects directly, you can do so by either joining the XeroLinux Forum or via the Mastodon instance. I will also mention that I have a Discord Server set up, if you feel like joining it, please do.&#xA;YouTube Project also has a YouTube Channel where I try my best to put out a new video every week on Wednesday, talking about ArchLinux and various ways I work on it.</description>
