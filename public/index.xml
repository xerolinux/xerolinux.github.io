      <description>Description With XeroLinux no longer being a Distro, but a collection of Projects/Scripts, created with a simple goal in mind, making ArchLinux easier to install and configure.&#xA;I have so many great ideas in the pipeline, it&amp;rsquo;s crazy ! I love working with ArchLinux. It&amp;rsquo;s the most flexible Distro I have ever had the pleasure to work with. Allowing me to build things from the ground up without it being too complex, or getting in my way.</description>

      <description>The Toolkit. This toolkit aims to be an all-in-one solution for post-installation, expediting your Arch setup. It&amp;rsquo;s offered as use at your own risk type of thing, with minimal support. You will have to rely on yourself and your own knowledge and ability to do research when it comes to the provided tools and your setup.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s crucial to clarify that this toolkit is NOT intended for custom Arch-Based distros. While some elements might function, I can&amp;rsquo;t ensure seamless compatibility due to potential conflicts arising from differing tweaks and repositories.</description>

I will try my best to answer. If I don&amp;rsquo;t, it just means I am either too busy or power is out as it usually is here in Lebanon. ;)&#xA;Social Media Ok, so, if you want to ask me questions about my projects directly, you can do so by either joining the XeroLinux Forum or via the Mastodon instance.</description>
