<p>With <strong>XeroLinux</strong> no longer being a Distro, but a collection of <em>Projects/Scripts</em>, created with a simple goal in mind, making <a href="https://archlinux.org"><strong>ArchLinux</strong></a> more approachable, easier to install and configure. That&rsquo;s if you choose to use it, or even give it a try.</p>

<h3 id="archlinux--kde-plasma">ArchLinux / KDE Plasma</h3>
<p>I have so many great ideas in the pipeline, it&rsquo;s crazy ! I love working with <strong>ArchLinux</strong>. It&rsquo;s the most flexible Distro I have ever had the pleasure to work with. Allowing me to build things from the ground up without it being too complex, or getting in my way.</p>
<p><figure class="center-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Wec0gAt.png"

</figure>
 <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I also love working with <strong>KDE Plasma</strong>, simply because it&rsquo;s so damn beautiful, and easy to work with. And since I am more of a visual old geezer, it fits my needs so well it ain&rsquo;t a joke. That&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t see myself using anything else for a long time to come.</p>
<p>With the combination of those 2 elements, life on <strong>Linux</strong> has been a joyous one indeed. To know more about my projects, check the relevant pages out on this site. And feel free to let me know what you think of the new site design. I am always looking for ways to make it better as time passes.</p>
<p>I will do my best to keep contributing to this awesome community. Mostly targeting <a href="https://archlinux.org"><strong>ArchLinux</strong></a> and <a href="https://kde.org"><strong>KDE Plasma</strong></a>. But who knows what the future holds ? I sure don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Cheers y&rsquo;all ðŸ˜€</p>

<p>The project is made of a few sub-projects. Below you will find the 3 I have finished and are ready for public consumption. More are on the way. Just keep coming back here for updates. Also feel free to suggest ideas on social&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="the-toolkit">The Toolkit.</h3>
<p>This toolkit aims to be an <em>all-in-one</em> solution for post-installation, expediting your Arch setup. It&rsquo;s offered as use at your own risk type of thing, with minimal support. You will have to rely on yourself and your own knowledge and ability to do research when it comes to the provided tools and your setup.</p>
<p><figure class="center-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/JuWceYE.png"
    alt="specs">
</figure>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crucial to clarify that this toolkit is <strong>NOT</strong> intended for custom Arch-Based distros. While some elements might function, I can&rsquo;t ensure seamless compatibility due to potential conflicts arising from differing tweaks and repositories. To ensure optimal performance, it&rsquo;s strongly recommended for use on a clean Pure-Arch install executed through the ArchInstall script. Nor will it provide Arch or DE/WM installations.</p>
<p>To find out how to use it and what it has in store, please head on over to toolkit&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/xerolinux/xlapit-cli"><strong>Github Page</strong></a> and check out the <a href="https://github.com/xerolinux/xlapit-cli/wiki"><strong>Wiki</strong></a> for more detailed information.</p>
<h3 id="xero-layan-rice">Xero-Layan Rice</h3>
<p>Well, I dunno how to describe this besides that it&rsquo;s the best <strong>KDE</strong> rice I have ever created, in my opinion. It has survived many upgrades, without missing a beat. Now since <strong>Plasma 6</strong> it has developed a few small quirks, nothing major though. I will be addressing them as I figure out how to fix them.</p>
<p><figure class="center-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/VA2tycb.jpeg"

<p>Until then, if you want to enjoy said rice on your system, feel free to teleport to <a href="https://github.com/xerolinux/xero-layan-git"><strong>Github</strong></a> to see how you can do that. And have fun. ðŸ˜€</p>
<h3 id="xero-plasma-install-script">Xero-Plasma Install Script</h3>
<p>Hmm&hellip; With the help of this script you will be able to install <strong>Plasma</strong> in one of 4 methods as you can see in the image below. Not only that, it will also install the GPU drivers and do necessary steps to get things working without you having to lift a finger. Oh yeah it will also fix <strong>PipeWire</strong> and <strong>Bluetooth</strong>.</p>
<p><figure class="center-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/rVvTimG.png"

<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Please keep in mind that script is only intended for machines with either a single GPU or in case you of a <em>Hybrid</em> laptop only <em>nVidia + Intel</em> is supported as it stands. However script will evolve as I get new hardware in. So for now feel free to teleport to <a href="https://github.com/xerolinux/xero-plasma"><strong>Github</strong></a> to see how use this script. And let me know what you think.</p>

<p>Although I also have a <a href="https://discord.gg/5sqxTSuKZu"><strong>Discord</strong></a> Server set up, it&rsquo;s currently not very active. it&rsquo;s sorta private, hence its name. It&rsquo;s not set up to provide support for any of my projects, it&rsquo;s just there for us to discuss everything from life to Open Source and other stuff. It&rsquo;s also a place where we share project updates and ideas. So hop on if you wish to join the discussions&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="youtube">YouTube</h3>
<p>Project also has a <a href="https://youtube.com/@XeroLinux"><strong>YouTube Channel</strong></a> where I try my best to put out a new video every week on Wednesday, talking about <strong>ArchLinux</strong> and various ways I work on it.</p>

<p>Sometimes I try to talk about my favorite apps and utilities and everything in between. I hope you enjoy this type of content. Also make sure to join my monthly Live Streams which take place at the end of every month where we can discuss the various topics related to <strong>Open Source</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="darkxeros-blog">DarkXero&rsquo;s Blog</h3>
<p>I have also started a blog where I will be sharing my thoughts and ideas while I work on current a nd future projects. It&rsquo;s a place for me to vent a little bit.

<p>Below are the specs of my main Rig, the one I use to test &amp; build <a href="https://xerolinux.xyz"><strong>XeroLinux</strong></a>. Also the one I game on and much much more.</p>

<p>I also have a <a href="https://windowstip.com/laptop/dell-xps-13-9360/#internal-specs"><strong>DELL XPS 13 / 9360</strong></a> Laptop that has a stupid 4K Touch Screen, <strong>Intel Core i7-7500U</strong>, 16GB RAM,  and an <strong>Intel HD Graphics 620</strong> iGPU. I primarily use it for testing stuff. From various Distros to various Kernels. It&rsquo;s starting to show its age right about now lol.</p>

<p>The other laptop I own is an old a$$ <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/111975"><strong>Apple MacBook Pro</strong></a> that only has one purpose, to use <strong>Adobe Photoshop</strong>. I try to keep it as up-to-date as possible without having to resort to <em>Hacky</em> forced updates. It has lost its battery and has a small crack on the screen. I will keep it around until it dies a thousand deaths hehe.</p>
