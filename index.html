<h3 id="whats-this-">WHAT’S THIS ?</h3>
<p>This is <strong>XeroLinux -</strong> an <em>Arch-based</em> Distro with <strong>KDE Plasma</strong> Desktop, a personal project I am working on that I thought I would share, in case someone out there shares my passion for building <strong>Linux</strong>.</p>

<p>As the saying goes &ldquo;Necessity is Mother of all creations&rdquo;, that&rsquo;s where all this came from. This was just an exercise for me, meaning it&rsquo;s an example of what can be done.</p>
<p>Over the past however many months, I have used many different <strong>Linux</strong> distributions and always had to go throught and spend a while getting them exactly the way I like. Doing this over and over as many times as I have systems (5 in my case), making sure it was compatible with all of them, was always a pain.</p>
<p>I needed a Distro that would make the job much easier, and that would allow me to get up and running much faster.</p>		
<p>After a lot of hard work, thanks to <strong>ALCI</strong> or <strong>A</strong>rch <strong>L</strong>inux <strong>C</strong>alamares <strong>I</strong>nstaller (an <strong>ArcoLinux</strong> project to easily install Arch using Calamares) by my good friend and Linux mentor <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ErikDubois/videos" target="_blank"><strong>Erik Dubois</strong></a> I was able to bring my vision to life.</p>					
<p>Anyway, For installation guide head on to the &ldquo;Installation&rdquo; section&hellip;</p>

<p>That said grab your ISO below, hosted on <strong>SourceForge.net</strong></p>

<p>Now that we have established that this Distro was made for myslef primarily exercising my knowledge thus far, and that I shall continue my endeavour to learn more as I go, to be able to provide as much support as I can. Learning is fun. Watch video below for a detailed How-To...</p>

<p><center><h3><strong>~~~ SAMBA Script Post-Install ~~~</strong></h3></center></p>					
<p>I added an <em>&ldquo;Alias&rdquo;</em> that can be run to install and configure <strong>SAMBA</strong>, should you need it. Just run <strong>&ldquo;smb&rdquo;</strong> command in Terminal, follow instructions, making sure username you select is the same as you current one, then reboot.</p> <p>There are tons of other aliases, to see them all, type <strong>&ldquo;alias&rdquo;</strong> in Terminal, or open the file <em>.bashrc</em> found in your home directory.</p>	
<p>Finally, If you are new to Linux or not ready to do a bit of research then, this Distro is not for you.</p>

<h3 id="package-list-explained">My Calamares Config Explained</h3>
<p>I made package list Dynamic, so it will be constantly changing, meaning that if you install it today, and I add/change a few things installing it in the future will present you with a different list, much the same but with a few packages removed or added, I did it this way so I don&rsquo;t have to re-compile and re-upload ISO as I do not have enough bandwidth to spare, but for now I will try to explain below some of the sections below :</p>
<p><figure>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/kRJk9bc.png#center" width="100%"/> 
	</figure></p>					
<p><strong>- Core :</strong> This is the main section, where you select Kernel and GPU Drivers, be careful though, if you select wrong GPU drivers for your Hardware you might end up with the infamous "Black Screen/No Desktop" issue. <strong>Do Your Research Beforehand. It's ESSENTIAL..</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note : Don&rsquo;t forget to select your Processor&rsquo;s Microcode, it&rsquo;s very important !</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Apps :</strong> Here you can choose what apps you want out of the box. Many to select from. All very useful. I don&rsquo;t put useless stuff.</p>
<p><strong>- Gaming :</strong> If you want games, here&rsquo;s where you select Launcher of choice with some &ldquo;Native&rdquo; games. Note if you select games it will make installation take much longer.</p>
<p><strong>- Extras :</strong> This is where you can select a few more stuff I consider Extras. Like some custom tools by ArcoLinux and some themes.</p>

<h3 id="no-internet-connection-issue">No Internet Connection</h3>
<p>Some users out there have reported an issue where <strong>Calamares</strong> installer was showing a message saying it&rsquo;s wasn&rsquo;t able to establish a connection to the Internet. 		
<p><figure>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/azblZkT.png#center" width="100%"/>

<p>I have no idea why it happens or how to fix it beyond that&hellip; Will have to wait and see, maybe it'll be fixed in next version of <strong>Calamares</strong> :(</p>

<h3 id="nvidia-issue">nVidia GPUs</h3>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s a known fact that <strong>nVidia</strong> don&rsquo;t play well with Linux, so if you have an old Laptop/Desktop with an older GPU or Hybrid Intel/nVidia, you might get stuck with <em>No Desktop</em>, which means you didn't do enough reserach on the subject and selected wrong Drivers.</p>
<p>I included all the Drivers I know of in the list, it's up to you <strong>Do Your Research</strong> Before attempting to install... Best of luck on your journey ;)</p>
