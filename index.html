<h3 id="whats-this-">WHAT’S THIS ?</h3>
<p>This is <strong>XeroLinux -</strong> an <em>Arch-based</em> Distro with <strong>KDE Plasma</strong> Desktop. Now I know not everyone likes my choice of DE, but that&rsquo;s my own preference.</p>
<p>This is NOT a full-on Distro, it's just <em>ArchLinux</em> with <em>Vanilla KDE Plasma</em> nothing more. I just added <strong>BeautyLine</strong> as default icon pack, and moved panel to the top with <strong>LatteDock</strong> enabled by default. That's it.</p>
<p><strong>XeroLinux -</strong> is unlike other Distros, it doesn't mess with any System Files, many other Distros heavily alter them, then they try to convince you that it's for better performance, which in itself introduces many points of failure. I leave the choice entirely up to the user. That being said this Distro was mainly for myself, but sharing is caring so it's online ;)</p>
<p>Anyway, it was made possible by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ErikDubois/videos" target="_blank"><strong>Erik Dubois</strong></a> and the array of information over at the <a href="https://www.arcolinux.info/" target="_blank"><strong>ArcoLinux</strong></a> site(s)… Not to mention the peeps over at <a href="https://endeavouros.com/" target="_blank"><strong>EndeavourOS</strong></a>.</p>	
<p><strong>XeroLinux</strong> is based on a project by my good friend and Linux mentor <em>Erik Dubois</em> called <strong>ALCI</strong> or simply put <strong>A</strong>rch <strong>L</strong>inux <strong>C</strong>alamares <strong>I</strong>nstaller. Meaning it&rsquo;s an easier way to install <em>ArchLinux</em> using the <em>Calamares</em> Installer&hellip;</p>

<h3 id="how--why">How &amp; Why</h3>
<p>A lot of sleepless nights and hair-pulling later, I was able to build my own Distro, my way. As the saying goes &ldquo;Necessity is Mother of all creations&rdquo;, that&rsquo;s where all this came from.</p>
<p>This is just an exercise for me, meaning it&rsquo;s an example of what can be done. Just be weary that I have only been using Linux 8 months, so I am ill-suited to handle the troubleshooting others can with a team of devs behind them. For that, you will need to do your own troubleshooting via <strong>Google</strong> and the right communities like <strong>Discord</strong>, links in <strong>Social</strong> section.</p>
<p>If you decide to test it, don&rsquo;t do it on your production machine, do it in a VM first, then, if you like it, go for it. A VM is just that "Virtual" so it doesn't reflect Bare Metal, it's just to see what Distro will look n feel like.</p>
<p>Anyway, watch the above video to get a better idea of how It&rsquo;s built. For more info and installation guide head on to the &ldquo;Installation&rdquo; section&hellip;</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s where you can grab the ISO, but just letting you know that I won&rsquo;t be releasing any new versions unless absolutely necessary, and major changes have taken place that require me to. I am Data-Capped so cannot afford the bandwidth.</p>
<p>ISO was built with that in mind. Everything is pulled online nothing resides on ISO except <strong>Plasma DE</strong> and <strong>ArchLinux</strong> everything else is <em>NetInstall</em>&hellip; That said grab your ISO below, hosted on <strong>Mega.nz</strong></p>

<h3 id="first-steps">First Steps</h3>
<p>I added an <em>&ldquo;Alias&rdquo;</em> that needs to be run on first logon to fix a bug with GRUB - just run <strong>&ldquo;grubfix&rdquo;</strong> command in Terminal then reboot. There are tons of other aliases - type <strong>&ldquo;alias&rdquo;</strong> in Terminal to see them all.</p>
<p><strong>Very Important :</strong> Make sure to read each section&rsquo;s description, and note if you end up stuck with Desktop not loading, below under <strong>nVidia</strong> section you might get some clarification. Again, <strong>READ ENTIRE PAGE</strong> else I cannot help, and <strong>Google</strong> is your best friend...</p>
<p>Kindly keep in mind that I opted to include <strong>PARU -</strong> the <strong>AUR -</strong> Helper in my Distro. I think it's better maintained, and more scalable as a Helper. You could install other Helpers if you so wish, but all Aliases - in my Distro use <strong>PARU -</strong>, so if you opt to use another one you will need to update them accordingly.</p>
<p>Oh, and I also included the <strong>ArcoLinux Repositories</strong> for some extra packages. They have a good selection of apps and tweaks. But becareful not to install any "Desktop Configs" from there as they might mess things up. Always have a Backup before downloading, it's safest route to take.</p>					
<p>During installation you will have the option to install many packages, which will be pulled from the Internet, so you will have to have an active Internet connection otherwise nothing will show and you will see empty lists.</p>
<p><center><strong>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</strong></center></p>					
<h3 id="package-list-explained">Package List Explained</h3>
<p>The list is Dynamic so it will be constantly changing, meaning that if you install it today, and I add/change a few things installing it in the future will present you with a different list, much the same but with a few packages removed or added, I did it this way so I don&rsquo;t have to re-compile and re-upload ISO as I do not have enough bandwidth to spare, but for now I will try to explain below some of the sections below :</p>
<p><strong>- Core :</strong> This is the main section, where you select Kernel and GPU Drivers, be careful though, if you select wrong GPU drivers for your Hardware you might end up with the infamous "Black Screen" issue. <strong>Do Your Research Beforehand. It's ESSENTIAL..</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note : Don&rsquo;t forget to select your Processor&rsquo;s Microcode, it&rsquo;s very important !</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Apps :</strong> Here you can choose what apps you want out of the box. Many to select from. All very useful. I don&rsquo;t put useless stuff.</p>
<p><strong>- Gaming :</strong> If you want games, here&rsquo;s where you select Launcher of choice with some &ldquo;Native&rdquo; games. Note if you select games it will make installation take much longer.</p>
<p><strong>- Extras :</strong> This is where you can select a few more stuff I consider Extras. Like some custom tools by ArcoLinux and some themes.</p>

<h3 id="no-internet-connection-issue">No Internet Connection</h3>
<p>Some users out there have reported an issue where <strong>Calamares</strong> installer was showing a message saying it&rsquo;s wasn&rsquo;t able to establish a connection to the Internet. In that case you can still go ahead with installation, only caveat with this is, you cannot install any of the packages in the list. So go ahead with installation, do not check any of the boxes as it will not work spitting an error.</p>

<h3 id="nvidia-issue">nVidia GPUs</h3>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s a known fact that <strong>nVidia</strong> don&rsquo;t play well with Linux, so if you have an old Laptop/Desktop with an older GPU or even Hybrid Intel/nVidia, and you get stuck on <em>Black Screen Of Death</em>, then you will need to <strong>Google</strong> your way out of it as I do not have enough expertise on the subject.</p>
<p>I included all the Drivers I know of in the list, it's up to you <strong>Do Your Research</strong> Before attempting to install. As mentioned before, I am still in the early stages of my Linux adventure, so I am ill-equipped to help... Best of luck on your journey ;)</p>

<p>I try my best to stay on as few Social Networks as possible since nowadays privacy is very important.. Anyway see y&rsquo;all online. If you have any requests either <em>Ping-me</em> on Discord or <em>Tweet</em> at me, will try my best to reply back ;)</p>
