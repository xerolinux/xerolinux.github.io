<h3 id="whats-this-">WHAT’S THIS ?</h3>
<p>This is <strong>XeroLinux -</strong> an <em>Arch-based</em> Distro with <strong>KDE Plasma</strong> Desktop. Now I know not everyone likes my choice of DE, but that&rsquo;s my own preference.</p>
<p>This is the type of Distro, that can be used to build it your way. What this means, is, ISO only provides <strong>Arch/KDE Plasma</strong> with the rest left up to you to either, install media apps from Calamares, turning your system into a full-on Production Studio, or Development apps turning it into a Dev-Studio and so on. <strong>One ISO for all</strong>, is the idea. And everything will be pulled from the net so you will always have latest versions of packages.</p>
<p><strong>XeroLinux -</strong> also is unlike other Distros, it doesn't mess with any System Files, simply because, in my honest opinion doing so could introduce many points of failure.</p> 
<p><strong>Stability</strong> is the name of the game. At least that's what I aim for. I also prefer to leave the freedom of choice entirely up to the user. That being said this Distro was created mainly for myself, but I thought I'd share it, maybe someone out there might enjoy my work... ;)</p>
<p><center><h3><strong>~ Credits, Where Credit's Due ~</strong></h3></center></p>					
<p><strong>XeroLinux</strong> was made possible by the array of information over at the <a href="https://www.arcolinux.info/" target="_blank"><strong>ArcoLinux</strong></a> site(s)… Not to mention the peeps over at <a href="https://endeavouros.com/" target="_blank"><strong>EndeavourOS</strong></a>.</p>	
<p>It is mainly based on a <em>"What-if"</em> by my good friend and Linux mentor <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ErikDubois/videos" target="_blank"><strong>Erik Dubois</strong></a>, called <strong>ALCI</strong> or simply put <strong>A</strong>rch <strong>L</strong>inux <strong>C</strong>alamares <strong>I</strong>nstaller. Meaning it&rsquo;s an easier way to install <em>ArchLinux</em> using the <em>Calamares</em> Installer&hellip;. <a href="https://alci.online/" target="_blank"><strong>More-Info</strong></a></p>	
<p><center><h3><strong>~~~ Choices, choices, choices ~~~</strong></h3></center></p>	
<p>Building a custom <strong>ArchLinux</strong> Distro is all about choices right ? My choices might not agree with yours, it's fine, each individual uses different apps and has a different config than others, so I had to make my choices, I just wish I could satisfy everyone, but we all know that it's impossible... So I hope choices I made are good enough.</p>

<p>As the saying goes &ldquo;Necessity is Mother of all creations&rdquo;, that&rsquo;s where all this came from.</p>
<p>This was just an exercise for me, meaning it&rsquo;s an example of what can be done. Just be weary that I have only been using Linux 8 months, so I am ill-equipped to handle the troubleshooting others can with many years of experience behind them. For that, I do apologize. Join us on <strong>Discord Server</strong> link on social page, for some troubleshooting.</p>		
<p>Anyway, For installation guide head on to the &ldquo;Installation&rdquo; section&hellip;</p>

<h3 id="how-to-get-it">How To Get It</h3>
<p>Here&rsquo;s where you can grab the ISO. There will be a new release once a month, to keep it in Sync with <strong>ArchLinux's</strong> update cycle.</p>
<p>ISO was built with that in mind. Everything is pulled online nothing resides on ISO except <strong>Plasma DE</strong> and <strong>ArchLinux</strong> everything else is <em>NetInstall</em>&hellip; That said grab your ISO below, hosted on <strong>SourceForge.net</strong></p>

<p>Now that we have established that this Distro was made for myslef primarily exercising my knowledge thus far, and that minimal support is available as I continue my endeavour to learn more as I go, learning is fun. Enjoy... Watch video below for a detailed How-To...</p>
<p><strong>An Active Internet Connection Is Required</strong>, otherwise nothing will show and you will see empty lists.</p>

<p><center><em>Skip Part With "GrubFix" as it's no longer needed</em></center></p>		
<p><center><h3><strong>~~~ Things To Do Post-Install ~~~</strong></h3></center></p>					
<p>I added an <em>&ldquo;Alias&rdquo;</em> that can be run to install and configure <strong>SAMBA</strong>, should you need it. Just run <strong>&ldquo;smb&rdquo;</strong> command in Terminal, follow instructions, making sure username you select is the same as you current one, then reboot.</p> <p>There are tons of other aliases, to see them all, type <strong>&ldquo;alias&rdquo;</strong> in Terminal, or open the file <em>.bashrc</em> found in your home directory.</p>	
<p>Finally, it's <strong>Very Important :</strong> Make sure to <strong>READ ENTIRE PAGE</strong> before proceeding. What works for me might not work for you. If you are new to Linux or not ready to do a lot of research then <strong>DON'T GET MY DISTRO</strong></p>					
<p><center><strong>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</strong></center></p>					
<h3 id="package-list-explained">Package List Explained</h3>
<p>The list is Dynamic so it will be constantly changing, meaning that if you install it today, and I add/change a few things installing it in the future will present you with a different list, much the same but with a few packages removed or added, I did it this way so I don&rsquo;t have to re-compile and re-upload ISO as I do not have enough bandwidth to spare, but for now I will try to explain below some of the sections below :</p>
<p><figure>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/kRJk9bc.png#center" width="100%"/> 
	</figure></p>					
<p><strong>- Core :</strong> This is the main section, where you select Kernel and GPU Drivers, be careful though, if you select wrong GPU drivers for your Hardware you might end up with the infamous "Black Screen/No Desktop" issue. <strong>Do Your Research Beforehand. It's ESSENTIAL..</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note : Don&rsquo;t forget to select your Processor&rsquo;s Microcode, it&rsquo;s very important !</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Apps :</strong> Here you can choose what apps you want out of the box. Many to select from. All very useful. I don&rsquo;t put useless stuff.</p>
<p><strong>- Gaming :</strong> If you want games, here&rsquo;s where you select Launcher of choice with some &ldquo;Native&rdquo; games. Note if you select games it will make installation take much longer.</p>
<p><strong>- Extras :</strong> This is where you can select a few more stuff I consider Extras. Like some custom tools by ArcoLinux and some themes.</p>

<h3 id="no-internet-connection-issue">No Internet Connection</h3>
<p>Some users out there have reported an issue where <strong>Calamares</strong> installer was showing a message saying it&rsquo;s wasn&rsquo;t able to establish a connection to the Internet. 		
<p><figure>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/azblZkT.png#center" width="100%"/>

<p>I have no idea why it happens or how to fix it beyond that&hellip; Will have to wait and see, maybe it'll be fixed in next version of <strong>Calamares</strong> :(</p>

<h3 id="nvidia-issue">nVidia GPUs</h3>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s a known fact that <strong>nVidia</strong> don&rsquo;t play well with Linux, so if you have an old Laptop/Desktop with an older GPU or Hybrid Intel/nVidia, you might get stuck with <em>No Desktop</em>, which means you didn't do enough reserach on the subject and selected wrong Drivers.</p>
<p>I included all the Drivers I know of in the list, it's up to you <strong>Do Your Research</strong> Before attempting to install... Best of luck on your journey ;)</p>
