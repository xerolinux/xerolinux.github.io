<h3 id="whats-this-">WHAT’S THIS ?</h3>
<p>This is <strong>XeroLinux -</strong> an <em>Arch-based</em> Distro with <strong>KDE Plasma</strong> Desktop. Now I know not everyone likes my choice of DE, but that&rsquo;s what am into right now. Anyway, it was made possible by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ErikDubois/videos" target="_blank"><strong>Erik Dubois</strong></a> and the array of information over at the <a href="https://www.arcolinux.info/" target="_blank"><strong>ArcoLinux</strong></a> site(s)… Not to mention the peeps over at <a href="https://endeavouros.com/" target="_blank"><strong>EndeavourOS</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong>XeroLinux</strong> is based on a project by my good friend and Linux mentor <em>Erik Dubois</em> called <strong>ALCI</strong> or simply put <strong>A</strong>rch <strong>L</strong>inux <strong>C</strong>alamares <strong>I</strong>nstaller. Meaning it&rsquo;s an easier way to install <em>ArchLinux</em> using the <em>Calamares</em> Installer&hellip;</p>
<p>I opted to include <strong>PARU -</strong> the <strong>AUR -</strong> Helper in my Distro. I think it's better maintained, and more scalable as a Helper. You could install other Helpers if you so wish, but all Aliases - in my Distro use <strong>PARU -</strong>, so if you opt to use another Helper you will need to update them accordingly.</p>

<h3 id="how--why">How &amp; Why</h3>
<p>A lot of sleepless nights and hair-pulling later, I was able to build my own Distro, my way. As the saying goes &ldquo;Necessity is Mother of all creations&rdquo;, that&rsquo;s where all this came from.</p>
<p>This is just a P.O.C (Proof Of Concept), meaning it&rsquo;s an example that with perserverance and will-power, you can do it too. Just be weary that I have only been using Linux 8 months, so I am ill-suited to handle the troubleshooting others can with a team of devs behind them. For that, you will need to do your own troubleshooting via <strong>Google</strong> and the right communities like <strong>Discord</strong>, links in <strong>Social</strong> section.</p>
<p>If you decide to test it, don&rsquo;t do it on your production machine, do it in a VM first, then, if you like it, go for it. I created Distro in such a way, that, all it takes is booting it, meaning you can just minimize Installer <em>(Don&rsquo;t Close It)</em>, play around to get an idea of what it will look n feel once installed. If you decide you like it, proceed to installer.</p>
<p>Anyway, watch the above video to get a better idea of how It&rsquo;s built. For more info and installation guide head on to the &ldquo;Installation&rdquo; section&hellip;</p>

<h3 id="how-to-get-it">How To Get It</h3>
<p>Here&rsquo;s where you can grab the ISO, but just letting you know that I won&rsquo;t be releasing any new versions unless absolutely necessary, and major changes have taken place that require me to. I am Data-Capped so cannot afford the bandwidth.</p>
<p>ISO was built with that in mind. Everything is pulled online nothing resides on ISO except <strong>Plasma DE</strong> and <strong>ArchLinux</strong> everything else is <em>NetInstall</em>&hellip; That said grab your ISO below, hosted on <strong>Mega.nz</strong></p>
<center><h2 id="-download-iso-httpsmeganzfileqlzdwcrtkxh5yyecmjw808ymzmeugcil8pgxelny8s_wgkaeuqy"><a href="https://mega.nz/file/QLZDwCrT#kXH5YYecmjW808YMZmEugCiL8pgxELny8S_wgkAEUqY" target="_blank"><strong>~ Download ISO ~</strong></a></h2></center>

<h3 id="first-steps">First Steps</h3>
<p>I added an <em>&ldquo;Alias&rdquo;</em> that needs to be run on first logon to fix a bug with GRUB - just run <strong>&ldquo;grubfix&rdquo;</strong> command in Terminal then reboot. There are tons of other aliases - type <strong>&ldquo;alias&rdquo;</strong> in Terminal to see them all.</p>
<p><strong>Very Important :</strong> Make sure to read each section&rsquo;s description, and note if you end up stuck with Desktop not loading, below under <strong>nVidia</strong> section you might get some clarification. Again, <strong>READ ENTIRE PAGE</strong> else I cannot help, and <strong>Google</strong> is your best friend...</p>
<p>During installation you will have the option to install many packages, which will be pulled from the Internet, so you will have to have an active Internet connection otherwise nothing will be installed.</p>
<p><center><strong>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</strong></center></p>					
<h3 id="package-list-explained">Package List Explained</h3>
<p>The list is Dynamic so it will be constantly changing, meaning that if you install it today, and I add/change a few things installing it in the future will present you with a different list, much the same but with a few packages removed or added, I did it this way so I don&rsquo;t have to re-compile and re-upload ISO as I do not have enough bandwidth to spare, but for now I will try to explain below some of the sections below :</p>
<p><strong>- Core :</strong> That&rsquo;e where you select your Kernel &amp; drivers. If you want latest Stock Kernel, or any other one check one you prefer. AMD/Intel/nVidia ? Select one you got. Just don&rsquo;t skip nVidia part below before going ahead to next section. Also know that you can 2 Kernels installed at the same time you will be prompther during Boot which to boot from ;)</p>
<p><strong>Note : Don&rsquo;t forget to select your Processor&rsquo;s Microcode, it&rsquo;s very important !</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Apps :</strong> Here you can choose what apps you want out of the box. Many to select from. All very useful. I don&rsquo;t put useless stuff.</p>
<p><strong>- Gaming :</strong> If you want games, here&rsquo;s where you select Launcher of choice with some &ldquo;Native&rdquo; games. Note if you select games it will make installation take much longer.</p>
<p><strong>- Extras :</strong> This is where you can select a few more stuff I consider Extras. Like some custom tools by ArcoLinux and some themes.</p>
<p><strong>Dynamic List</strong> can also be benefical in such a way that you can request for a certain package to be added to the list, after I have tested and made sure it&rsquo;s useful and is bug free of course, at which point I will update list with it included, then on your end you don&rsquo;t have to re-download updated ISO, saving us both the hassle, so next time you install my Distro, package(s) will be present for you to select during installation. Win-Win ;)</p>

<h3 id="no-internet-connection-issue">No Internet Connection</h3>
<p>Some users out there have reported an issue where <strong>Calamares</strong> installer was showing a message saying it&rsquo;s wasn&rsquo;t able to establish a connection to the Internet. In that case you can still go ahead with installation, only caveat with this is, you cannot install any of the packages in the list. So go ahead with installation, do not check any of the boxes as it will not work spitting an error.</p>

<p>These are the steps, quit installer, then connect to net n hit F12 type in the command below, when Installer launches see if it still says no Internet. Or, reboot from ISO immediately quit installer n do as I said earlier.</p>
<h4 id="command">Command</h4>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">calamares_polkit -d
</code></pre></div><p>Not in my hands developer of installer hasn&rsquo;t fixed issue yet but he said it&rsquo;s coming. So we have to wait for that. Otherwise I have no idea why it happens or how to fix it beyond that&hellip; Will have to wait and see, till then install without selecting anything from list :(</p>

<h3 id="nvidia-issue">nVidia GPUs</h3>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s a known fact that <strong>nVidia</strong> don&rsquo;t play well with Linux, so if you have an old Laptop/Desktop with an older GPU or even Hybrid Intel/nVidia requiring 390x Drivers, and you get stuck on <em>Black Screen Of Death</em>, then you will need to <strong>Google</strong> your way out of it as I do not have enough expertise on the subject.</p>
<p>All I know is that you might need to try installing it without <strong>nVidia</strong> drivers, or with just the <strong>Intel</strong> ones. It&rsquo;s a Trial &amp; Error sort of deal. Just an FYI, selecting Microcode+Kernel without selecting any GPU Drivers especially on Hybrid setups could be the safest route, GPU drivers are there for those who need them, like 10 Series nVidia and newer... My Distro uses <strong>SDDM</strong> not <strong>LightDM</strong>, for compatibility. Best of luck on your journey ;)</p>

<p>I try my best to stay on as few Social Networks as possible since nowadays privacy is very important.. Anyway see y&rsquo;all online. If you have any requests either <em>Ping-me</em> on Discord or <em>Tweet</em> at me, will try my best to reply back ;)</p>
