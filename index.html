<h3 id="whats-this-">WHATâ€™S THIS ?</h3>
<p>This is <strong>XeroLinux -</strong> an <em>Arch-based</em> Distro with <strong>KDE Plasma</strong> Desktop, a personal project I am working on that I thought I would share, in case someone out there shares my passion for building <strong>Linux</strong>.</p>

<p>As the saying goes &ldquo;Necessity is Mother of all creations&rdquo;, and I needed a Distro fast!</p>
<p>Over the past however many months, I have tried many different <strong>Linux</strong> distributions, I, either didn't like them, or, when I did, I always had to go through and spend time getting them exactly the way I wanted, not to mention the fact that I had many different machines (5), each doing its own thing. Doing this over and over as many times as I have systems, was extremely painful and time consuming.</p>
<p>I needed a Distro that would help me get **Linux** with all my favorite apps on all my systems, fast, without much effort and that was compatible with them all. Once I found one that suited my needs, in this case <strong>ArchLinux</strong> with the highly customizable <strong>KDE Plasma</strong> Desktop, I got to work....</p>					
<p>After a lot of research, and learning, thanks to the magic of <a href="https://alci.online/" target="_blank"><strong>ALCI</strong></a> or <strong>A</strong>rch <strong>L</strong>inux <strong>C</strong>alamares <strong>I</strong>nstaller (an <a href="https://arcolinux.info" target="_blank"><strong>ArcoLinux</strong></a> project) by my good friend and Linux mentor <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ErikDubois/videos" target="_blank"><strong>Erik Dubois</strong></a> I was able to bring my vision to life.</p>		
<p>"If you can't find the best Distro for you, then <strong>BUILD YOUR OWN!</strong>". That's the power of <strong>ArchLinux</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="first-steps">First Steps</h3>
<p>Now that we have established that this Distro was made for myslef primarily exercising my knowledge thus far, and that I shall continue my endeavour to learn more as I go, to be able to provide as much support as I can. Learning is fun. Watch video below for a detailed How-To...</p>
<p><strong>An Active Internet Connection Is Required</strong>, otherwise nothing will show and you will see empty lists.</p>
<p><strong>F.Y.I :</strong> Low resolution in a VM ? Type (vset) in Terminal to set Resolution to 1080p. this will only chasnge resolution. It won't scale well, it's just for testing in VM. For better scaling manually change resolution via <strong>Display Settings</strong>.</p>

<p><center><em>Skip Part With "GrubFix" as it's no longer needed</em></center></p>		
<p><center><h3><strong>~~~ SAMBA Script Post-Install ~~~</strong></h3></center></p>					
<p>I added an <em>&ldquo;Alias&rdquo;</em> that can be run to install and configure <strong>SAMBA</strong>, should you need it. Just run <strong>&ldquo;smb&rdquo;</strong> command in Terminal, follow instructions, making sure username you select is the same as you current one, then reboot.</p> <p>There are tons of other aliases, to see them all, type <strong>&ldquo;alias&rdquo;</strong> in Terminal, or open the file <em>.bashrc</em> found in your home directory.</p>	
<p>Finally, If you are new to Linux or not ready to do a bit of research then, this Distro is not for you.</p>

<h3 id="package-list-explained">My Calamares Config Explained</h3>
<p>I made package list Dynamic, so it will be constantly changing, meaning that if you install it today, and I add/change a few things installing it in the future will present you with a different list, much the same but with a few packages removed or added, I did it this way so I don&rsquo;t have to re-compile and re-upload ISO as I do not have enough bandwidth to spare, but for now I will try to explain below some of the sections below :</p>
<p><figure>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/kRJk9bc.png#center" width="100%"/> 
	</figure></p>					
<p><strong>- Core :</strong> This is the main section, where you select Kernel and GPU Drivers, be careful though, if you select wrong GPU drivers for your Hardware you might end up with the infamous "Black Screen/No Desktop" issue. <strong>Do Your Research Beforehand. It's ESSENTIAL..</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note : Don&rsquo;t forget to select your Processor&rsquo;s Microcode, it&rsquo;s very important !</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Apps :</strong> Here you can choose what apps you want out of the box. Many to select from. All very useful. I don&rsquo;t put useless stuff.</p>
<p><strong>- Gaming :</strong> If you want games, here&rsquo;s where you select Launcher of choice with some &ldquo;Native&rdquo; games. Note if you select games it will make installation take much longer.</p>
<p><strong>- Extras :</strong> This is where you can select a few more stuff I consider Extras. Like some custom tools by ArcoLinux and some themes.</p>

<h3 id="no-internet-connection-issue">No Internet Connection</h3>
<p>Some users out there have reported an issue where <strong>Calamares</strong> installer was showing a message saying it&rsquo;s wasn&rsquo;t able to establish a connection to the Internet.

<p>I have no idea why it happens or how to fix it beyond that&hellip; Will have to wait and see, maybe it'll be fixed in next version of <strong>Calamares</strong> :(</p>

<h3 id="nvidia-issue">nVidia GPUs</h3>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s a known fact that <strong>nVidia</strong> don&rsquo;t play well with Linux, so if you have an old Laptop/Desktop with an older GPU, you might get stuck with <em>No Desktop</em>, which means you didn't do enough reserach on the subject and selected wrong Drivers.</p>
<h3 id="nvidia-hybrid">nVidia/Intel Hybrid</h3>
<p>In case you own a Laptop with <strong>Intel/nVidia Hybrid</strong> setup, the only currently working Combo is the following, in Calamares select, <strong>LightDM Login + nVidia GPU + Optimus-Manager + Optimus Manager-QT</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="lightdm-tips">LightDM Tips & Tricks</h3>			
<p>Below is a video with some <strong>LightDM</strong> tips and tricks by my good friend <a href="https://christitus.com/lightdm-configuration/" target="_blank"><strong>Chris Titus</strong></a>. I made an Alias to easily edit the Config file, just type 'nldm' once logged in and edit it.</p>
