### Some Info

The project is made of a few sub-projects. Below you will find the 3 I have finished and are ready for public consumption. More are on the way. Just keep coming back here for updates. Also feel free to suggest ideas on social...

### The Toolkit.

This toolkit aims to be an _all-in-one_ solution for post-installation, expediting your Arch setup. It's offered as use at your own risk type of thing, with minimal support. You will have to rely on yourself and your own knowledge and ability to do research when it comes to the provided tools and your setup.

It's crucial to clarify that this toolkit is **NOT** intended for custom Arch-Based distros. While some elements might function, I can't ensure seamless compatibility due to potential conflicts arising from differing tweaks and repositories. To ensure optimal performance, it's strongly recommended for use on a clean Pure-Arch install executed through the ArchInstall script. Nor will it provide Arch or DE/WM installations.

To find out how to use it and what it has in store, please head on over to toolkit's [**Github Page**](https://github.com/xerolinux/xlapit-cli) and check out the [**Wiki**](https://github.com/xerolinux/xlapit-cli/wiki) for more detailed information.

### Xero-Layan Rice

Well, I dunno how to describe this besides that it's the best **KDE** rice I have ever created, in my opinion. It has survived many upgrades, without missing a beat. Now since **Plasma 6** it has developed a few small quirks, nothing major though. I will be addressing them as I figure out how to fix them.

Until then, if you want to enjoy said rice on your system, feel free to teleport to [**Github**](https://github.com/xerolinux/xero-layan-git) to see how you can do that. And have fun. ðŸ˜€

### Xero-Plasma Install Script

Hmm... With the help of this script you will be able to install **Plasma** in one of 4 methods as you can see in the image below. Not only that, it will also install the GPU drivers and do necessary steps to get things working without you having to lift a finger. Oh yeah it will also fix **PipeWire** and **Bluetooth**.

Please keep in mind that script is only intended for machines with either a single GPU or in case you of a *Hybrid* laptop only _nVidia + Intel_ is supported as it stands. However script will evolve as I get new hardware in. So for now feel free to teleport to [**Github**](https://github.com/xerolinux/xero-plasma) to see how use this script. And let me know what you think.
