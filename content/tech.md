Below are the specs of my main Rig, the one I use to test & build [**XeroLinux**](https://xerolinux.xyz). Also the one I game on and much much more.

I also have a [**DELL XPS 13 / 9360**](https://windowstip.com/laptop/dell-xps-13-9360/#internal-specs) Laptop that has a stupid 4K Touch Screen, **Intel Core i7-7500U**, 16GB RAM,  and an **Intel HD Graphics 620** iGPU. I primarily use it for testing stuff. From various Distros to various Kernels. It's starting to show its age right about now lol.

The other laptop I own is an old a$$ [**Apple MacBook Pro**](https://support.apple.com/en-us/111975) that only has one purpose, to use **Adobe Photoshop**. I try to keep it as up-to-date as possible without having to resort to _Hacky_ forced updates. It has lost its battery and has a small crack on the screen. I will keep it around until it dies a thousand deaths hehe.
