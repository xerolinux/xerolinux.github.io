### Social Media

Ok, so, if you want to ask me questions about my projects directly, you can do so by either joining the [**XeroLinux Forum**](https://forum.xerolinux.xyz) or via the [**Mastodon**](https://fosstodon.org/@XeroLinux) instance. I will also mention that I have a [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/5sqxTSuKZu) Server set up, if you feel like joining it, please do.

### YouTube

Project also has a [**YouTube Channel**](https://youtube.com/@XeroLinux) where I try my best to put out a new video every week on Wednesday, talking about **ArchLinux** and various ways I work on it.

### DarkXero's Blog

I have also started a blog where I will be sharing my thoughts and ideas while I work on current a nd future projects. It's a place for me to vent a little bit. Blogging software am using is [**Hexo**](https://hexo.io). I am still getting the hang of it, ig you can help out there I would be eternally greatful. Check it out [**Here**](https://blog.xerolinux.xyz). ;)
