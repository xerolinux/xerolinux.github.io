#### How To Contact me.

There are many ways to contact me. Just make sure to select the right method. I will answer you as fast as I can, all i ask for is a little bit of *patience*. I will try my best to answer. If I don't, it just means I am either too busy or power is out as it usually is here in **Lebanon**. ;)

#### Linux Related

Ok, so, if you want to ask questions related to **Linux**, you can do so by either joining the [**XeroLinux Forum**](https://forum.xerolinux.xyz) or via the [**Mastodon**](https://fosstodon.org/@XeroLinux) instance. Project also has a [**YouTube Channel**](https://youtube.com/@XeroLinux) and a [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/5sqxTSuKZu) Server. ;)
