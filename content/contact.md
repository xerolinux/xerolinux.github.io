#### How To Contact me.

There are many ways to contact me. Just make sure to select the right method. I will answer you as fast as I can, all i ask for is a little bit of *patience*. I will try my best to answer. If I don't, it just means I am either too busy or power is out as it usually is here in **Lebanon**. ;)

#### Social Media

Ok, so, if you want to ask me questions about my projects directly, you can do so by either joining the [**XeroLinux Forum**](https://forum.xerolinux.xyz) or via the [**Mastodon**](https://fosstodon.org/@XeroLinux) instance.

Although I also have a [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/5sqxTSuKZu) Server set up, it's currently not very active. it's sorta private, hence its name. It's not set up to provide support for any of my projects, it's just there so where we discuss everything from life to Open Source and stuff in between. It's also a place where we share updates and ideas. So hop on if you wish to join the discussions...

#### YouTube

Project also has a [**YouTube Channel**](https://youtube.com/@XeroLinux) where I try my best to put out a new video every week on Wednesday, talking about **ArchLinux** and various ways I work on it.

Sometimes I try to talk about my favorite apps and utilities and everything in between. I hope you like the content. Also make sure to join my monthly Live Streams which take place at the end of every month where we can discuss the various topics related to **Open Source**.

If you want to support me financially during my country's worst **Economic Crisis** in decades, there are 3 ways to do so currently. You can either do it via [**Fundraizr**](https://fundrazr.com/xerolinux), [**Ko-Fi**](https://ko-fi.com/xerolinux) or by becoming a [**Github-Sponsor**](https://github.com/sponsors/xerolinux)
