### Social Media

Ok, so, if you want to ask me questions about my projects directly, you can do so by either joining the [**XeroLinux Forum**](https://forum.xerolinux.xyz) or via the [**Mastodon**](https://fosstodon.org/@XeroLinux) instance.

Although I also have a [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/5sqxTSuKZu) Server set up, it's currently not very active. it's sorta private, hence its name. It's not set up to provide support for any of my projects, it's just there for us to discuss everything from life to Open Source and other stuff. It's also a place where we share project updates and ideas. So hop on if you wish to join the discussions...

### YouTube

Project also has a [**YouTube Channel**](https://youtube.com/@XeroLinux) where I try my best to put out a new video every week on Wednesday, talking about **ArchLinux** and various ways I work on it.

Sometimes I try to talk about my favorite apps and utilities and everything in between. I hope you enjoy this type of content. Also make sure to join my monthly Live Streams which take place at the end of every month where we can discuss the various topics related to **Open Source**.

### Support Me / My Cause

In case you weren't aware of the current situation in **Lebanon**, let me put it this way, it's bad, real bad. Jobs are extremely hard to come by due to the financial situation we have been suffering for the past few years. As a result I currently have no choice but to rely on you, my dear fans, at least until situation improves. Without your support none of this would have been possible. I thank every one of you who have pleged a few pennies here n there.

So, if you want to support me financially during my country's worst **Economic Crisis** in decades, there are 3 ways to do so currently. You can either do it via [**Fundraizr**](https://fundrazr.com/xerolinux), [**Ko-Fi**](https://ko-fi.com/xerolinux) or by becoming a [**Github-Sponsor**](https://github.com/sponsors/xerolinux)
