### Description

With **XeroLinux** no longer being a Distro, but a collection of _Projects/Scripts_, created with a simple goal in mind, making [**ArchLinux**](https://archlinux.org) more approachable, easier to install and configure. That's if you choose to use it, or even give it a try.

### ArchLinux / KDE Plasma

I have so many great ideas in the pipeline, it's crazy ! I love working with **ArchLinux**. It's the most flexible Distro I have ever had the pleasure to work with. Allowing me to build things from the ground up without it being too complex, or getting in my way.

I also love working with **KDE Plasma**, simply because it's so damn beautiful, and easy to work with. And since I am more of a visual old geezer, it fits my needs so well it ain't a joke. That's why I don't see myself using anything else for a long time to come.

Cheers y'all ðŸ˜€
