## Description

**XeroLinux** whilst no longer a Distro, it's now more a collection of _Projects/Scripts_, created with a simple goal in mind, making [**ArchLinux**](https://archlinux.org) easier to install and configure.

So far, project includes, the **Ultimate Arch Post-Install Toolkit**, a simple **KDE Plasma** installer script and finally a script that will make it easy to apply my **Xero-Layan** rice.

Check other pages out on the site for more information. And feel free to let me know what you think of the new site design. I am always looking for ways to make it better as time passes.

I will do my best to keep contributing to this awesome community. Mostly targeting [**ArchLinux**](https://archlinux.org) and [**KDE Plasma**](https://kde.org). But who knows what the future holds ? I sure don't.

Cheers y'all ðŸ˜€
