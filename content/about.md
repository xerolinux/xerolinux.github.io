### Description

With **XeroLinux** no longer being a Distro, but a collection of _Projects/Scripts_, created with a simple goal in mind, making [**ArchLinux**](https://archlinux.org) more approachable, easier to install and configure. That's if you choose to use it, or even give it a try.

### ArchLinux / KDE Plasma

I have so many great ideas in the pipeline, it's crazy ! I love working with **ArchLinux**. It's the most flexible Distro I have ever had the pleasure to work with. Allowing me to build things from the ground up without it being too complex, or getting in my way.

I also love working with **KDE Plasma**, simply because it's so damn beautiful, and easy to work with. And since I am more of a visual old geezer, it fits my needs so well it ain't a joke. That's why I don't see myself using anything else for a long time to come.

With the combination of those 2 elements, life on **Linux** has been a joyous one indeed. To know more about my projects, check the relevant pages out on this site. And feel free to let me know what you think of the new site design. I am always looking for ways to make it better as time passes.

I will do my best to keep contributing to this awesome community. Mostly targeting [**ArchLinux**](https://archlinux.org) and [**KDE Plasma**](https://kde.org). But who knows what the future holds ? I sure don't.

Cheers y'all ðŸ˜€
